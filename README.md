# City of Paris Route Finder

This project is a JavaFX application designed to find routes between landmarks in Paris. It uses graphs and well-known algorithms to provide various routing functionalities. Below is a list of features implemented or yet to be implemented.

## Features to Implement
### Completed Features
- [] **(GUI):** Create a JavaFX GUI that provides graphical feedback on the map, including marking and linking landmarks on the route.
- [] **Custom Graph Data Structure/Classes:** Developed a custom graph structure to represent Paris landmarks and their roads.
- [] **Single Valid Route Generation:** Generate any single valid route between two landmarks.
- [] **Multiple Route Permutations (DFS):** Generate multiple valid routes between two landmarks using Depth-First Search (DFS).
- [] **Shortest Route with Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest route between two landmarks using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- [] **Shortest Route with Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Identify the shortest route pixel-by-pixel on the map between two points.
- [] **Most Cultural/Historic Route:** Calculate the most culturally or historically significant route between two landmarks using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- [] **Waypoint Support:** Add support for specifying intermediate waypoints between the starting and destination points (not supported in BFS).
- [] **Avoid Specified Points/Landmarks:** Allow users to mark points to avoid in routes (not supported in BFS).
- [] **JUnit Testing:** Perform unit testing using JUnit for key components.
- [] **JMH benchmarking:** Implement JMH benchmarking for critical methods.
